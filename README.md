# TutoringAnalysis
Project Overview: As a tutor in the Computer Information Systems lab in Bentley, I realized that there was an opportunity to leverage unused data from the student tutees, leading me to start an initiative to analyze and automate insights using Google API and Google Cloud for real-time updates and data privacy, using the data to get fresh perspectives on tutoring peak hours, higher demanded courses, and optimize the tutoring schedule.

Role: I implemented data pipelines and visualization tools (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) to process and analyze over 6,000 students visits, presenting a narrative to my tutoring co-workers to further understand performance. 

Impact: Handled the process of integrating the service to other tutoring services on campus, laying the groundwork for automation and data-driven decision-making on campus before going abroad, further mentoring other students to continue the project for them to strive to scale the project across other university services.
