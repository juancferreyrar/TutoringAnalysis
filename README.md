# TutoringAnalysis
I utilized the Google Sheets API and Google Cloud to ensure real-time updates and enhanced data privacy, automating operations across tutoring centers. Leveraging my Python skills along with data visualization and web development techniques, I created a robust, cloud-integrated application that supports data-driven decisions for optimized resource allocation, tutor scheduling, and improved student engagement. Additionally, I automated the process of data collection and analysis, using Google Cloud to enable live updates of analytics, further streamlining the administrative tasks and ensuring that decision-making is based on the most current data available.
