# TutoringAnalysis
This application is meant to be an interactive application for all tutoring departments in Bentley University: "LEAF Lab" for Accounting, Economics and Finance classes, "CLIC Lab" for Languages and International Colaboration, "Mathematics Learning Center" for Math courses, "Writing Center" for English and Media Studies, and others. What originally started as an individual analysis for the Computer Information Systems Sandbox was automized to help other departments visualize and manage their information better.
